                The John's Hopkins versus Yeshiva basketball game was played
                without a single fan in the stadium due to one of the Yeshiva
                player's testing positive for Covid-19. Coronavirus was not a
                major threat to the sporting world yet.

              The Golden State Warriors hosted the Philadelphia 76ers in San
              Francisco. They still had fans at their games as again,
              Coronavirus was not quite spreading faster then light yet. Golden
              State did however, put signs up everywhere warning fans that
              attending the game might increase their risk of contracting
              Covid-19.

              The Indian Wells tennis tournament is often called the fifth major
              of tennis because it is such a big tournament. Players, including
              Venus Williams and Rafael Nadal, were already on site practicing
              when Indian Wells became the first major sporting event to cancel
              to try to hault the spread of Covid-19.

              Most sporting seasons still were not cancelled yet, but the MLB,
              NBA, NHL, and MLS all closed their locker room to outside
              personell. This meant no press and no one who didn't work directly
              or closely with the team. The sporting world sitll seemed pretty
              normal at this point and most assumed that the Coronavirus would
              just blow over.

              This was the day that the Ivy League became the first NCAA
              conference to not play any of their winter sports for the
              remainder of the winter season. From the standpoint of a
              student-athlete, no one understood why. Not many people knew how
              serious the Coronavirus actually was, and this seemed like an
              overreaction. We would soon see in days, and months to come that
              this was not an overreaction at all. Many tournaments across other
              leagues and conferences were announcing play without fans.

              The state of the pandemic became real to most players and
              athletes. Most leagues announced that their games would be played
              with no fans. The Ivy league, ahead of everyone again, went agead
              and cancelled their spring season as well. This now made other
              conferences, including our ACC, worry that they would soon follow.
              The NHL played five games that night, most major collegiate
              conferences announced they would continue play without fans, but
              the NBA had suspended their season.

              This is the day everything took a turn downhill. The ACC and most
              other major conferences suspended their seasons. The ATP tennis
              tour suspended tournament play. The MLS suspended its season. The
              PGA tour cancelled its season. Players and athletes were on planes
              or at competition events and the plug was being pulled on their
              competition. Professional athletes were starting to test positive
              for Coronvirus and sports would not be the same for a very long
              time.

              In typical Friday the 13th fashion, this day was not a good one
              for the sporting world. The Masters was postponed, NASCAR was
              suspended, the Boston Marathon was postponed. Late the night
              before all other major leagues had cancelled their season. It was
              now clear to everyone that the pandemic was real and that the
              world was about to change.
